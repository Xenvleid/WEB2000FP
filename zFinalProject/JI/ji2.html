<p style= "color: lightblue">Iglesias was born and raised in Madrid, where his family lived in an upper-middle-class neighbourhood. After finishing his secondary education, Iglesias went on to study law at the urging of his father. At the same time he played on the junior reserve squad of the popular Real Madrid professional football (soccer) club. However, his aspirations of becoming a professional football player ended when he became partially paralyzed in his early twenties because of a benign spinal tumour. During his lengthy recovery, Iglesias was given a guitar by one of his nurses, and he taught himself to play by accompanying songs on the radio. After he had sufficiently recovered mobility, Iglesias was sent to study English in the United Kingdom. During that time he penned his first single, “La vida sigue igual” (“Life Goes on as Usual”), with which he won a Spanish song competition in 1968.</p>
